# ShaderMaker4
A source code template to build FreeframeGL 2.1 plugins for Resolume from GLSL Sandbox or ShaderToy shaders.\
During compilation, shader and image files are loaded into into resources and saved with the plugin. The plugin then accesses these resources when it loads. ShaderToy multiple buffers are not supported. This is a Windows project for Visual Studio 2017.

## How to install and build
1) Download a zip file of this master branch or from the latest release
2) Unzip it somewhere
3) Download the Resolume FFGL 2.1 repository zip file from the ffgl2.1 branch which is the most recent released version of the sdk - https://github.com/resolume/ffgl/tree/ffgl2.1
4) Unzip it somewhere
5) Copy the folder SHADERMAKER4\source\plugins\ShaderMaker4 to the "..\source\plugins\" folder.
6) Copy the two files in SHADERMAKER4\build\windows to the "..\build\windows" folder
7) Open "..\build\windows\FFGLPlugins.sln" in Visual Studio 2017
8) RH click on "sources" in the Solution Explorer and select "Add > Existing project"
9) Browse to "..\build\windows" and select "ShaderMaker4.vcxproj"
10) Change to "Release" and "x64" build
11) RH click on the ShaderMaker4 project and "Build"
12) The resulting ShaderMaker4.dll plugin is in "..\binaries\x64\Release".

## How to use
Copy the shader text file you require into the SHADERS folder, subfolder SOURCE or EFFECT.
Copy any images that the shader will use to the TEXTURES folder.
Edit "shaderfiles.h" to reference those files (see examples in "shaderfiles.h")..
- Define "EFFECT_PLUGIN" for an effect that uses a texture from the host.
- Define the RESOLUTION_WIDTH for a source plugin to balance performance with resolution.
- Change the plugin Name, ID and information in ShaderMaker.cpp, build and rename the resulting dll.\
Example shaders and details in "shaderfiles.h".

## FreeframeGL 1.6
The orginal ShaderMaker project for FreeframeGL 1.6 is preserved un-changed in the ffgl1.6 branch. It is self-contained and will build 32 bit and 64 bit plugins for both Windows and OSX. These are not compatible with Resolume 7 but are suitable for other host programs using FreeframeGL 1.6.
